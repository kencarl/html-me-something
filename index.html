                    <h2>First Things First</h2>
                    <p>You are probably wondering what led me to China. Why spend 6 months there? Did I understand anything? 
                       Isn't the food weird? There are a myriad of valid questions on why I went to China. 
                       To sum it up, I went to China through a mixture of hard work and stumbling into it. One of my
                       professors recommended the Chinese program at my university and in a "why not" moment I decided 
                       to take Chinese 1. This led me to many late nights spent studying with my 同学们(classmates) and 
                       bonding with them over how difficult the class was (no English allowed in class!). During Chinese 2
                       we were informed that there is summer study abroad program to China and I decided that no matter
                       what I was going. <br><br>The following events transpired over 2 trips to China for roughly 3 months at a time.  </p>

                    <h2>Daily Life</h2>
                    <p>The majority of my time in China was spent in Qingdao, a mid-sized city (for China!) of
                        roughly 9 million  people. In Qingdao I studied at the Ocean University of China and had an
                        internship at a local travel agency. Beyond that, I spent time volunteering, living with a 
                        couple of different Chinese families, and also participating in a study tour to many other places.
                        Such as, exploring Beijing, climbing numerous mountains, and visiting one of the oldest cities
                         in China, Xi'an.

                    <h2>The Mountains are Calling</h2>
                    <p>Scaling mountains is a common past time in China and as a visitor from a flat state like
                        Florida I had to indulge myself. During my stay in China I climbed 2 of the 5 sacred 
                        mountains of China in addition to another 5 mountains. The sacred mountains have been
                        important destinations of pilgrimage for thousands of years. Mountain hiking 
                        is a very common hobby in China for people of all ages. Imagine the looks on our
                        faces when were climbing these mountains and we were being passed up by people 60-70 years old!

                    <h2>The Great Wall</h2>
                    <p>When speaking of traveling to China the Great Wall is often highlighted as a must see location
                        to visit. The phrase Bú dào Chángchéng fēi hǎohàn (不到长城非好汉) perfectly encapsulates the 
                        significance of it. Often translated as "Not reach Great Wall not good man" or 
                        "He who doesn't reach the Great Wall is no hero" we learned this phrase as we heading for the wall.
                        Something that I did not appreciate about the Great Wall before visiting it was that the wall itself
                        is along the top of mountains so just getting up to the wall is an ordeal in of itself!

                    <h2>Volunteering</h2>
                    <p>During my stay we had many opportunities to volunteer and help out the communities while also
                        learning about the culture and everyday life. Some of the volunteer activities we did were teaching
                        classes of elementary school students, spending time at a school for autistic children, helping out the 
                        elderly in retirement communities, and helping a middle school raise money by selling newspapers to 
                        sponsor the education of 2 students.

                    <a name = "Homestay family"></a>
                    <h2>Homestay Family</h2>
                    <p>My professor put an emphasis on cultural immersion and part of that was arranging for us
                        to spend weekends with Chinese families. He went as far as to vet the families to make sure that
                        they were not only safe to spend time with, but also that their level of English ability was 
                        very low or non-existent forcing us to utilize our Chinese skills.
                        <br><br>
                        One of the families I stayed with was a mom and dad with their two younger children. One boy
                        and one girl. The parents were business owners so they were often busy so I spent most of
                        the time with their kids. They showed me around the city area nearby, demonstrated how well they
                        played their instruments, I played soccer with them, and also attended their English tutoring session. 
                        We even got to celebrate the daughters birthday while I was there! The family was so gracious in letting me 
                        stay with them that they even invited me to come back whenever I wanted and on the second trip to China
                        that is exactly what I did. We agreed that if they ever come to visit the United States that I would
                        be their tour guide here.

                    <h2>Internship</h2>
                    <p>For my second trip to China a part of the program was that we had to have an internship as it
                        would be an excellent learning experience. My internship was at a local travel agency where I had to
                        assist in creating travel itineraries, host their clients, and run errands for the CEO. During my
                        experiencing I learned how to be even more proficient at navigating the city by myself, learn proper
                        tea etiquette for hosting clients, and learned more about workplace culture. Overall it was an
                        amazing learning experience and I am glad that I got to meet so many new people to learn even more from.
